# Project Updates - 2025-10-22

## Payment Integration for Recharge System

### Overview
Integrated third-party payment gateway for real payments (Alipay/WeChat) in the recharge system.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Payment Service Implementation
- **File**: `app/Services/PaymentService.php`
- Created payment service to interface with third-party payment gateway
- Implemented signature generation using MD5 with lowercase format
- Payment gateway URL: `http://202.95.8.8:12345`
- **Key Methods**:
  - `createPayment()` - POST JSON request to payment gateway
  - `getPaymentParams()` - Returns URL + params for form submission
  - `generateSignature()` - Creates MD5 signature (lowercase with `&key=` format)
  - `verifyCallback()` - Verifies incoming callback signatures
  - `getPayType()` - Maps payment methods (currently using '111' for testing)

#### 2. Payment Model
- **File**: `app/Models/Payment.php`
- Created detailed payment transaction tracking model
- Auto-generates payment numbers: `PAY20251022153045ABC123`
- **Fields**: gateway, payment_method, amount, fee, actual_amount, status, callback_data (JSON)
- **Methods**: `markAsCompleted()`, `markAsFailed()`, `getStatusText()`, `getMethodText()`

#### 3. Payment Callback Controller
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/PaymentCallbackController.php`
- Handles payment gateway callbacks
- **Routes**:
  - `POST /payment/callback` - Async webhook handler
  - `GET /payment/return` - Sync redirect handler
- Verifies signatures, creates Payment records, fulfills orders
- Credits user account with bonus if applicable

#### 4. Intermediate Payment Page
- **File**: `resources/js/pages/Recharge/Payment.vue`
- Created to avoid HTTPS/HTTP mixed content errors
- Uses HTML form POST submission instead of AJAX redirect
- Auto-submits after 1.5 seconds with manual fallback button

#### 5. Configuration
- **File**: `config/payment.php`
- Payment gateway configuration
- **Environment Variables** (`.env` and `.env.example`):
  ```
  PAYMENT_API_URL=http://202.95.8.8:12345
  PAYMENT_PARTNER_ID=upe8909d
  PAYMENT_API_KEY=062ac6b5c05770ea
  ```

#### 6. Recharge Controller Updates
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/RechargeController.php`
- Integrated PaymentService
- Handles both fake (test) and real (Alipay/WeChat) payments
- For real payments: creates Payment record, generates form data, shows intermediate page

#### 7. Routes
- **File**: `routes/web.php`
- Added payment callback routes:
  ```php
  Route::post('/payment/callback', [PaymentCallbackController::class, 'callback']);
  Route::get('/payment/return', [PaymentCallbackController::class, 'returnUrl']);
  ```

### Payment Flow
1. User selects recharge package or amount
2. Chooses payment method (Alipay/WeChat/Test)
3. System creates Order and Payment records
4. For real payments: redirects to intermediate page that POSTs form data to payment gateway
5. Payment gateway processes payment and sends callback
6. System verifies signature, updates order status, and credits user account with amount + bonus

## Home Page Updates - Hot Posts Image Display

### Overview
Implemented image thumbnail display for posts in the 热门帖子 (Hot Posts) section on the home page.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Backend - HomeController
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php` (lines 33-48)
- Updated to fetch first 4 images from Spatie MediaLibrary
- Maps images to include both full URL and thumbnail URL
- Stores in `post_images` array property

```php
$recentPosts = Post::with(['user.creatorProfile', 'category', 'media'])
    ->published()
    ->latest('published_at')
    ->limit(8)
    ->get()
    ->map(function ($post) {
        // Get first 4 images from media library
        $post->post_images = $post->getMedia('images')->take(4)->map(function ($media) {
            return [
                'url' => $media->getUrl(),
                'thumb' => $media->getUrl('thumb'),
            ];
        })->toArray();
        return $post;
    });
```

#### 2. Frontend - Home.vue
- **File**: `resources/js/pages/Home.vue`
- Updated Post interface to include `post_images` array
- Added image thumbnail grid display in posts list
- **Display Format**:
  - Small thumbnails: 80px × 80px (w-20 h-20)
  - Horizontal row layout with maximum 4 images
  - Uses thumbnail version for faster loading
  - Rounded corners with proper spacing

```vue
<div v-if="post.post_images && post.post_images.length > 0" class="flex gap-2 mb-4">
    <div
        v-for="(image, index) in post.post_images.slice(0, 4)"
        :key="index"
        class="relative overflow-hidden rounded-lg w-20 h-20 flex-shrink-0"
    >
        <img
            :src="image.url"
            class="w-full h-full object-cover"
            :alt="`${post.title} - Image ${index + 1}`"
        />
    </div>
</div>
```

### Visual Layout
- Images appear between post excerpt and post footer
- Maximum 4 images displayed per post
- Single horizontal row (no wrapping)
- Small, consistent thumbnail size

## Media Library - Image Conversions Implementation

### Overview
Implemented automatic generation of image variations (thumbnails and medium-sized images) when uploading images to posts using Spatie MediaLibrary.

### Problem
- Images were being uploaded but thumbnail and medium conversions were not being generated
- Conversions were queued by default but queue worker wasn't processing them
- Existing media had no conversions

### Solution

#### 1. Media Library Configuration
- **File**: `config/media-library.php`
- Published configuration file: `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\MediaLibrary\MediaLibraryServiceProvider"`
- Changed line 32: `'queue_conversions_by_default' => false`
- This forces conversions to be generated synchronously (immediately) instead of being queued

#### 2. Post Model Configuration
- **File**: `app/Models/Post.php` (lines 266-279)
- Already properly configured with conversion definitions:

```php
public function registerMediaConversions(Media $media = null): void
{
    $this->addMediaConversion('thumb')
        ->width(300)
        ->height(300)
        ->sharpen(10)
        ->performOnCollections('images');

    $this->addMediaConversion('medium')
        ->width(800)
        ->height(600)
        ->sharpen(10)
        ->performOnCollections('images');
}
```

#### 3. PostController Updates
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php`
- Added `->withResponsiveImages()` to media uploads
- **Line 202-204** (store method):
```php
$post->addMedia($file)
    ->withResponsiveImages()
    ->toMediaCollection('images');
```
- **Line 328-330** (update method):
```php
$post->addMedia($file)
    ->withResponsiveImages()
    ->toMediaCollection('images');
```

#### 4. Regenerated Existing Media
- Command: `php artisan media-library:regenerate`
- Processed all 21 existing media files
- Generated thumb and medium conversions for each

### Image Conversions Specs
- **Thumbnail**: 300×300px, sharpened
- **Medium**: 800×600px, sharpened
- **Storage**: `/storage/app/public/{media_id}/conversions/`
- **Naming**: `{filename}-thumb.jpg`, `{filename}-medium.jpg`

### Verification
- Conversions are now generated immediately when uploading images
- Both thumb and medium sizes are available
- Existing media has been regenerated with conversions
- No queue worker needed - conversions happen synchronously

---

## Technical Notes

### Image Processing
- **GD Extension**: Installed ✓
- **Imagick Extension**: Installed ✓
- **Image Driver**: GD (configured in `config/media-library.php`)

### Media Storage
- **Disk**: public
- **Base Path**: `/storage/app/public/`
- **Structure**: `/{media_id}/{filename}` and `/{media_id}/conversions/{filename}-{conversion}.jpg`

### Important Architectural Decision
**Always use Spatie MediaLibrary for post images**, not the `images` column in the posts table. The `images` column exists but should not be used for image storage - all images should go through the media library system to ensure conversions are generated properly.

## Testing Notes

### Payment Gateway
- Currently using payment type code `'111'` for testing purposes
- Test payment method (fake) works without gateway
- Real payment methods (Alipay/WeChat) redirect to payment gateway
- Signature format: `param1=val1&param2=val2&key=API_KEY` → MD5 → lowercase

### Image Uploads
- Upload images when creating/editing posts
- Check that thumb and medium conversions are generated
- Verify images display on home page in hot posts section
- Confirm images display correctly on post detail pages

---

## Next Steps / TODO

### Payment Integration
- [ ] Confirm correct payment type codes with payment gateway provider
- [ ] Test real Alipay payment flow
- [ ] Test real WeChat payment flow
- [ ] Set up proper error handling for failed payments
- [ ] Implement payment status checking/queries

### Image Processing
- [ ] Consider implementing lazy loading for post images
- [ ] Add image compression/optimization settings
- [ ] Consider adding more conversion sizes if needed
